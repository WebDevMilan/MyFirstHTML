# MyFirstHTML
I am going to create a very basic structure of a HTML file to practice some basic tags and attributes which include the following:

    * DOCTYPE declaration
    * Head tag with a title tag
    * H1 tag with a title
    * Embedded an image
    * Created the following three links on my page:
      * One link that is `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
      * Second link in bold.
      * Third link with a placeholder so it goes nowhere.
    * Created an ordered list of steps to make a sandwich.
    * Created an unordered list of 5 bands/musicians I like.
    * Created a table with 2 columns (animal class and animal name) and 4 rows of animals.
    * Used an alternate way of separating links without line breaks.
    * Embedded a Youtube video.
